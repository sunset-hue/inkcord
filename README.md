A discord API wrapper made from standard libraries, not requiring any dependencies (except websocket, since it's really complicated to implement)

## Why use this wrapper?
uhh it's cool and also it doesn't really require a lot of package downloading and downloads a lot faster

The structure of this library is a bit of discord.py inspiredness and the rest is my dumb design
